## HTML Markup

* Use BEM from [preparation](00-preparation)
* When writing markup use HTML5 tags!
* Use [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) for initial fillers

### Reminder when writing markup:

* You will need to use CSS transitions to display mobile menu (slide down)  
* You will have to change hamburger icon to close (x) icon when menu is open  
* You will need to make so that clicking on navigation item makes it active
* Clicking on search (magnifying glass), shows search input field on black background according to design.
    * The black background with input field should fade in/out when opened/closed.
    
* There should be at least one element in navigation, which has child elements.
    * Child elements should show up on mouse over parent element or on touch devices after the first tap on parent element.
