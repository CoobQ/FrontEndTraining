#Hero requirements

* Hero carousel should be developed using objects, each slide should be an object  
* Carousel has to be loopable  
* Image and text has to slide, but the buttons should stay at the same place  
* Use sliding transitions when switching between items (might create Parallax effect - image and text slide at different speeds)  
* Make sure that carousel does not break if next slide is selected, but transition has not finished  
* You may use PostCSS plugins or SASS for CSS development
